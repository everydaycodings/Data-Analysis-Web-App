### **Data Analysis Web App** can analysis data in multiple formates(csv, txt, xls, xlsx, ods, odt) and gives shows you the analysis in the most informative way. 


## Features Of Data Analysis Web App
- Supports **Multiple file formates**(csv, txt, xls, xlsx, ods, odt).
- Gives a **detailed overview** of your data.
- You have the option to **plot graphs** for your data.
- YOu can see **Outliers** in your data in a visulization way.
- You can *drop* *multiple columns* and *rename columns*.
- You can *drop* **multiple categorical Rows** and **Numerical Rows** by giving **multiple conditions**.
- You can **download/export** your edited data.

## Upcomming Features for the WebApp:
- Multilebel classification system for images 
- Multiple classification system for *vedios*
- More pleasant looking UI and many more...
